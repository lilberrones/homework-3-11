# How the Internet Works
![](images/internetdiagram.gif)

In order to access a web page, your modem/ router will send a request to a DNS server provided by your internet service provider.
 From there the DNS server will direct you to an online directory of places as to where the current IP address you are looking for. After the DNS server has reached the appropriate place, it will contact the web server of where you are looking towards, and redirect your traffic.
 The web server will then send you a return packet of data, of which will is coming directly from a database, thus allowing you to see a displayed web page.
